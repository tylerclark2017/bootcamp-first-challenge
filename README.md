# bootcamp-first-challenge: This README, along with the index.html file and CSS style sheet, have been completed for the Bootcamp's first Challenge. I edited the starter code to follow semantic HTML formatting, and changed any appropriate CSS class or element selectors as needed in order for the website to function. The website itself is a landing page for the company Horiseon, which is a self-described "Social Solutions" company. The website features three links in the header that are associated with the images and descriptions toward the bottom of the page that describe what Horiseon offers, as well as explanations for those services: Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing--in addition to a side column with explanations for additional services including Lead Generation, Brand Awareness, and Cost Management.

## Disclosures: The code source for this website is located in the index.html file inside the repository that is linked for this Challenge. I also utilized the Xpert Learning Assistant to assist me in finalizing my code, ensuring that the semantic elements I used to change the "div" and "span" elements included in the starter code were correct. 

## Here is a link to the deployed website: https://tylerclark2017.github.io/bootcamp-first-challenge/
