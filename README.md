## Disclosures: The code source for this website is located in the index.html file inside the repository that is linked for this Challenge. I also utilized the Xpert Learning Assistant to assist me in finalizing my code, ensuring that the semantic elements I used to change the "div" and "span" elements included in the starter code were correct. 

## Here is a link to the deployed website: https://tylerclark2017.github.io/bootcamp-first-challenge/

## Here are screenshots of the final product. Please let me know if they do not load!
